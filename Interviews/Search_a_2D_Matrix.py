"""
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.

This matrix has the following properties:

    * Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.

    * The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Example
Consider the following matrix:

[

    [1, 3, 5, 7],

    [10, 11, 16, 20],

    [23, 30, 34, 50]

]

Given target = 3, return true.
